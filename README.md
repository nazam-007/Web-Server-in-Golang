# Go Web Server Project

This is a basic web server implemented in Go. It serves static files and handles specific routes (`/hello` and `/form`).

## Features

1. **Serve Static Files**: Serves files from the `static` directory when users visit the root URL (`/`).
2. **Handle `/hello` Route**: Responds with "Hello" if the request method is GET.
3. **Handle `/form` Route**: Processes form data submitted to `/form` and responds with the form input values.
